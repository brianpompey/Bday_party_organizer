birthday party planner for elementary school

Welcome to Flatiron Elementary School's Birthday Party Organizer!!

Since we have such a big school and only two event venues on campus (the gymnasium and the cafeteria) we would like all
teachers to log their's students info (names and birthdays) so we can properly schedule a little birthday party for each
and every student in out school.

This website will give each teacher the opportunity to log in, insert each of their student's info and choose a venue for
their birthday party. If there is a conflict with dates and location, the teacher may be asked to choose another day or another
location for the party.
